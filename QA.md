Q: What is the smallest value of L such that the agorithms produce exactly the above DFA's?
A:Since the algorithm produces a minimum DFA, the DFA's in problem 1, has to be minimum DFA's.

Q: What happens when the strings are longer than L? 
A: When strings are longer than L, you can not be sure that the result is valid. Because the path to the node from root is not generated in the tree.

Q: How is L related to the DFAs? 
A: L is the depth of the tree and will determine the size of the DFA.
